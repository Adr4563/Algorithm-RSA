# Introduction 📖
RSA, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, stands as one of the pioneering achievements in modern cryptography. This public-key cryptosystem is extensively employed for secure data transmission across various digital platforms. Its significance lies in its utilization of asymmetric encryption, employing a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Key features of RSA:
- **Public Key**: Used for encrypting data, widely distributed and known.
- **Private Key**: Kept secret and used for decrypting data.

The security foundation of RSA hinges on the formidable challenge of factoring large prime numbers, which underpins the generation of its keys. This approach ensures that intercepted encrypted messages remain indecipherable to unauthorized entities.
